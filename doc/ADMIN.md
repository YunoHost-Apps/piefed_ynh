### Configuration file

Some settings can be altered to customize your usage of Piefed.
The user environment file is in `__INSTALL_DIR__/.user.env`.
You can find more information on the upstream installation documentation: <https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi/src/tag/v__YNH_APP_MANIFEST_VERSION__/INSTALL.md>

Do not alter `__INSTALL_DIR__/.env`, as it will be modified upon every app upgrade.
