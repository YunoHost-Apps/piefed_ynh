A federated forum and link-aggregator.

*Excerpts from its website and its repository:*
Federated, open‑source, ad‑free, and fully under your control.
Build or join a community that reflects your values – no algorithms, no corporate overlords.

No ads. No tracking. No addictive algorithms.
Your feed is built by you.

Federated freedom. Posts on one server can be seen, shared, and discussed by users on any other server, too.
Everything runs on open standards (ActivityPub), creating a diverse and billionaire-resistant ecosystem.
